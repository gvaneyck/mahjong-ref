# General Strategies

These are some loose guidelines to follow when getting started

---

* Starter hands
  * **Riichi** - Call **Riichi** when you are in **Tenpai** and haven't made any calls
  * **All Simples** - No 1s, 9s, or honor tiles
  * **All Triplets** - Four triplets and a pair
  * **Half Outside** - Every set and pair has a 1, 9, or honor tile in it
  * **Half Flush** - One suit and honor tiles only
  * **Pure Straight** - One through nine in a suit
  * **Dragons**, **Prevalent Wind**, **Seat Wind** - Have a triplet that gives you a **Yaku**.
    This is a very easy way to win quickly
  * **Pinfu** - [**Pinfu**](README-closed-only-yaku.md) is a complicated hand, but combines easily
    with other **Han** for a possibly high scoring hand
* When to **call**
  * Whenever you **call**, you're giving up a draw for the tile you're **calling**, so
    make sure it improves your hand, e.g. don't **call** **Chii** on a 6 **Sou** when you
    already have a 345 **Sou** sequence
  * **Call** if it gets you lots of **Dora** and you still can get a **Yaku**, e.g. **call** **Pon**
    on a **Dora**
  * **Call** if you have a high value hand whose value isn't impacted too much by
    being open.  E.g. **All Triplets**, **Half/Fully Outside**, **Half/Full Flush**,
    or when you have two or more **Dora** and/or **Red Five**s
  * **Call** if you need to get into **Tenpai** because the round is ending soon.  My
    metric is ~25 tiles left
  * **Call** because you're scared of someone else's high value hand and want to
    win before they do.  E.g. if they **called** **Pon** on a **Dora**
  * **Call** because you're ahead in points and are trying to end the game quickly
    before anyone surpasses you
  * **Call** **Kan** because you want to luck into some **Dora** to make your hand worth
    something.  Remember that an open **Kan** will remove your opportunity to
    **Riichi** and get the **Uradora**
  * **Call** **Kan** because you're desperate for more tiles and **Kan** gives you an extra
    draw
  * You can hold a concealed **Kan** in hand to get a double draw on a later turn
