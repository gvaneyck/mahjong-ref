# Closed-Only Yaku

These are Yaku that are only possible if you never call any tiles until you win.
Concealed Kans (drawing all four of a tile yourself) are OK

---

#### Fully Concealed Hand (1 Han)
Draw the winning tile yourself (Tsumo)

#### Riichi (1 Han)
When in Tenpai, ante 1000 points which will go to the winner.  You are no longer allowed
to change your hand.

#### Pinfu (1 Han)
Four sequences and a pair.  The wait must be an open wait, e.g. have a 34 waiting on
a 2 or 5.  No honors allowed except the pair may be non-Yakuhai (not seat wind,
not prevalent wind, not dragon)

#### Pure/Twice Pure Double Sequence (1/3 han)
An identical sequence twice in the same suit.  Twice Pure if done twice,
e.g. 112233 Pin + 223344 Sou + any pair

#### Seven Pairs (2 han)
Have seven pairs
