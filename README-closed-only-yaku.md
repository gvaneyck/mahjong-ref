# Closed-Only Yaku

These are **Yaku** that are only possible if you never **call** any tiles until you win.
**Concealed Kan**s (drawing all four of a tile yourself) are OK

---

### Fully Concealed Hand (1 Han)
Draw the winning tile yourself (**Tsumo**)

### Riichi (1 Han)
When in **Tenpai**, ante 1000 points which will go to the winner.  You are no longer allowed
to change your hand.

### Pinfu (1 Han)
Four sequences and a pair.  The wait must be an open wait, e.g. have a 34 waiting on
a 2 or 5.  No honors allowed except the pair may be non-**Yakuhai** (not seat **wind**,
not prevalent **wind**, not **dragon**)

### Pure/Twice Pure Double Sequence (1/3 Han)
An identical sequence twice in the same suit.  Twice Pure if done twice,
e.g. 112233 **Man** + 223344 **Man** + any pair

### Seven Pairs (2 Han)
